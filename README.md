# Bitnami Symfony Development Container

## TL;DR;

### Local workspace

```bash
$ mkdir ~/myapp && cd ~/myapp
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

### Eclipse Che workspace

Launch an on-demand Symfony development workspace in Eclipse Che by clicking the link below:

[![Symfony Development Workspace](http://beta.codenvy.com/factory/resources/codenvy-contribute.svg)](https://beta.codenvy.com/f/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbitnami%2Fbitnami-docker-symfony%2Ftree%2Fche)

You can find the configuration files used on the previous link in the [Che branch](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/tree/che). For more information about Eclipse Che workspaces check the [official documentation](https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/introduction).

## Introduction

[Symfony](http://symfony.com/), is a web application framework written in [PHP](http://www.php.net) under [MIT License](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/license.html).

The Bitnami Symfony Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Symfony development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Symfony Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Symfony Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Symfony application:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/myapp
$ cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```bash
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-symfony/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Finally launch the Symfony application development environment using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

The above command creates a container service for Symfony development and bootstraps a new Symfony application, named `myapp` in working directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

After the built-in PHP application server has been started, visit http://localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the Symfony welcome page.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Symfony Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```
where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples:

- Create a new project named `foo`:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject foo
  ```

- Create a new project named `bar` which uses Symfony version `2.5.0`

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject "bar 2.5.0"
  ```

  Note: In the above two examples the `docker-compose.yml` file should be updated so that the `SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME` specifies the project name that should be served my the PHP application server.

## Issues

If you encountered a problem running this container, you can file an [issue](../../issues/new). For us to provide better support, be sure to include the following information in your issue:

- Host OS and version (`$ uname -a`)
- Docker version (`$ docker version`)
- Docker info (`$ docker info`)
- Docker image version (`$ echo $BITNAMI_IMAGE_VERSION` inside the container)
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
